Hello everyone, my name is Vincent

I used to worked as software developer over 8 years ago but stopped practicing since i've moved more towards client facing technical role.
Doing the odin project to refresh back my programming knowledge and also to buffer for career shift.

This project will be to practice what i have re-learnt in HTML for creating multiple recipes.
