Hello everyone, my name is Vincent

I used to worked as software developer over but stopped practicing since i've moved more towards client facing technical role 8 years ago.
Doing the odin project to refresh back my programming knowledge and also to buffer for career shifs in the future.

This project will be to practice what i have re-learnt in HTML for creating multiple recipes.
