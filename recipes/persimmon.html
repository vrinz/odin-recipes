        <img src="../images/Persimmon_bread.jpg" alt="Persimmon Bread">
        <p>Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the <em>sweet flesh is easy to scoop away</em> from the persimmon skin with a spoon</p>
        <p>The humble persimmon is oft forgotten, except by those who already love its honey-like flavor and know that it is only available to enjoy during a short season.</p>
